# AI/Spec-Driven Book with Embedded RAG Chatbot Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy: Verified Technical Content
All content must be technically accurate and verified through official documentation, tutorials, and authoritative sources. No unverified claims or speculative information allowed.

### Clarity: Professional, Readable Style (Flesch-Kincaid 10-12)
All content must maintain professional, readable style with Flesch-Kincaid grade level between 10-12. Writing should be clear, concise, and technically precise.

### Spec-driven: Follow Spec-Kit Plus Structure Strictly
All development must follow Spec-Kit Plus structure with strict adherence to specification-driven development methodology. All changes must be documented in specs before implementation.

### Reproducibility: Code and Chatbot Fully Functional
All code examples must be executable and reproducible. The RAG chatbot must be fully functional with zero errors in deployment and operation.

### Interactivity: RAG Chatbot Answers from Selected Book Content Only
The RAG chatbot must only provide answers based on the specific book content provided, not general knowledge. Accuracy and contextual relevance to book sections is paramount.

### Source Verification: ≥50% Official Documentation Sources
At least 50% of all content must be verified through official documentation, tutorials, and authoritative sources. All sources must be properly cited and traceable.

## Key Standards

### Content Quality Standards
- All content must be technically precise with verified information
- Chatbot must provide accurate, contextual answers that reference specific book sections
- Writing must be clear, concise, and maintain professional standards
- All code examples must be executable with working examples provided

### Deployment Standards
- Final product must be Docusaurus-ready for documentation
- Must deploy successfully to GitHub Pages
- Chatbot must be fully functional with zero errors in production
- All content must be in Markdown format with proper code snippets

## Constraints

### Content Constraints
- Word count: Chapters must be 1,500–3,000 words each
- Total word count: Overall book should be ~15,000–25,000 words
- Format: All content in Markdown with executable code snippets
- Content must be technically accurate and verifiable

### Technical Constraints
- All examples must be executable and reproducible
- Chatbot must only reference book content, not external sources
- Docusaurus-ready structure required for deployment
- GitHub Pages deployment must be error-free

## Success Criteria

### Specification Compliance
- Complete adherence to Spec-Kit Plus structure and methodology
- All content must be verified and traceable to official sources
- Chatbot must accurately answer questions from book content only
- Fully deployable system with zero operational errors

### Quality Assurance
- All technical content verified through official documentation
- Chatbot responses must be accurate and contextual to book sections
- Deployment must be fully functional with no errors
- Content must meet readability standards (Flesch-Kincaid 10-12)

## Governance

### Amendment Process
This constitution may only be amended through the formal Spec-Kit Plus amendment process. All changes must be documented with clear rationale and impact assessment. Amendments require explicit approval and must maintain the core principles of accuracy, clarity, and spec-driven development.

### Compliance Requirements
All development work must comply with these constitutional principles. Any deviation must be explicitly documented and justified. Regular compliance reviews must be conducted to ensure adherence to accuracy, clarity, and spec-driven requirements.

### Versioning Policy
Version numbers follow semantic versioning. Major versions for principle changes, minor for additions, patches for clarifications. All changes must be tracked with ISO date format.
