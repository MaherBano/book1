# What is Artificial Intelligence?

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define Artificial Intelligence in clear terms
- Identify examples of AI in everyday life
- Distinguish between different types of AI systems

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

## Defining AI

At its core, AI is about creating systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. This includes:

- Recognizing patterns
- Understanding natural language
- Solving problems
- Learning from experience
- Making decisions

## Types of AI

There are several ways to categorize AI systems:

1. **Narrow AI**: Systems designed to perform a specific task (e.g., facial recognition, internet searches)
2. **General AI**: Systems that possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across various domains
3. **Superintelligent AI**: Hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in all domains

## Examples of AI in Daily Life

- Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)
- Recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon)
- Navigation apps (Google Maps)
- Email filtering (spam detection)
- Image recognition (photo tagging)

## Key Concepts in AI

- **Machine Learning**: A subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed
- **Deep Learning**: A specialized form of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers
- **Natural Language Processing**: Technology that enables machines to understand and respond to human language
- **Computer Vision**: Technology that allows machines to interpret and understand visual information

## Summary

This lesson introduced the fundamental concept of Artificial Intelligence, its various forms, and examples of how it's already integrated into our daily lives. Understanding these basics provides a foundation for exploring more advanced AI concepts in subsequent lessons.

## Next Lesson

In the next lesson, we'll explore Machine Learning Fundamentals, diving deeper into how AI systems actually learn from data.
