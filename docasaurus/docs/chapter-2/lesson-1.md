# Introduction to Robotics and Robot Components

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify the basic components of a robotic system
- Understand how different components work together
- Recognize the role of each component in robot functionality

## Introduction

Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science to design, construct, operate, and apply robots. A robot is a programmable machine that can carry out a complex series of actions automatically.

## Core Components of a Robot

Every robot consists of several key components:

1. **Power Supply**: Provides energy to the robot (batteries, solar panels, etc.)
2. **Actuators**: Convert energy into motion (motors, pistons, etc.)
3. **Sensors**: Gather information about the environment (cameras, tactile sensors, etc.)
4. **Controller**: The robot's "brain" that processes sensor data and sends commands
5. **Mechanical Components**: The physical structure and joints that allow movement

## Power Supply Systems

Robots require energy to operate, and they can be powered in various ways:
- Battery systems (primary or rechargeable)
- Direct connection to power sources
- Solar panels for outdoor robots
- Fuel cells for long-duration missions

## Actuators: Making Robots Move

Actuators are responsible for robot motion and can be:
- Electric motors (DC, AC, stepper, servo)
- Hydraulic actuators (for high force applications)
- Pneumatic actuators (using compressed air)

## Sensors: The Robot's Senses

Robots gather information through various sensors:
- Vision systems (cameras, LIDAR)
- Tactile sensors (for touch and pressure)
- Proximity sensors (for obstacle detection)
- Inertial sensors (for orientation and movement)

## Controllers: The Robot's Brain

The controller processes sensor information and makes decisions:
- Microcontrollers for simple robots
- Single-board computers for more complex systems
- Specialized robotics computers for advanced applications

## Summary

This lesson covered the fundamental components that make up robotic systems, from power supplies to controllers. Understanding these components is essential for grasping how robots function and interact with their environment.

## Next Lesson

In the next lesson, we'll explore Sensors and Actuators in detail, examining how robots perceive their environment and take action based on that perception.
