## Prompt

Create or update the project constitution from interactive or provided principle inputs, ensuring all dependent templates stay in sync

## Response snapshot

I've created a comprehensive constitution for your Spec-Driven Book Creation project following the structure and requirements. The constitution includes:

- Core principles for clarity, progressive learning, accuracy, reproducible examples, spec-driven development, AI constraints, Docusaurus standards, and version control
- Content integrity requirements for ethical sourcing and consistency
- Development workflow requirements for specifications, planning, and QA
- Governance section establishing the authority and compliance requirements of the constitution

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created new constitution for book creation project based on requirements
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with completed constitution
